## About the Project

Telling Tailes is a collaborative project to develop an Android "AI Story Generation Social Network" mobile application. 

The application leverages Firebase to provide users the ability to draft "Stories" using GPT-3 based on a series of prompts fed back into each other. Users can post, share, and promote other users' "Stories."

This project served as a way to get more familiar with Android SDK and also served as an excuse to play with the (at the time nascent) GPT public APIs.
